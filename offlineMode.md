# Use the offline mode for Liberty
{: #offline_mode}

When a Liberty application is pushed to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} the Liberty buildpack can access sites external to Bluemix
to acquire artifacts required by the application.  The following are the external sites that the Liberty buildpack can access.  In [Bluemix Dedicated](/docs/dedicated/index.html#dedicated) and
[Bluemix Local](/docs/local/index.html#local) environments these sites may need to be *whitelisted*.

* https://download.run.pivotal.io, and https://java-buildpack.cloudfoundry.org are used to access components for:
  * [AppDynamics agent ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.appdynamics.com/)
  * [MariaDB JDBC driver ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://mariadb.com/)
  * [New Relic agent](newRelic.html)
